# hello-world
I am simply trying to learn a new computer language, after retirement

Goooooodmorning!

I am working with a program call PLM trying to learn SCALA.
The last time that I was in Tech school was 1985. I learned basic language programming
It was hard to translate the glassy-eyed look of the teachers when they talked about
the future of the comoputer industry and programming.
